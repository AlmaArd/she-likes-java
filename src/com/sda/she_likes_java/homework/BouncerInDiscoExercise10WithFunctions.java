// A story about bouncers in a disco
//Prepare a new class BouncersInDiscoStory and in it
//- get the userâ€™s age, ability to sing well and height from the console
//- there are two bouncers in the disco: young and old
//- Young checks if the person is adult, tall (or short :)) and can sing well
//- Old has some kind of sight problem - so if any of the conditions are met, the person can enter the disco
//- people try to cheat, so if someone is rejected by the young bouncer they try again with the old one:)
